# Third-party software

Fairway XMP bundles independently licensed software. The Fairway XMP application code is MIT licensed; that license does not replace the licenses of bundled components.

Linux fnm corresponding sources include the unmodified tag, all locked Rust crates, and an offline reconstruction recipe.

fnm uses unmodified upstream source/CLI behavior. macOS distribution re-signs its universal release binary as part of normal nested-code signing; Windows/Linux binaries are copied unchanged.

Runtime staging retains upstream license, notice, and copying files under `runtime/licenses` and within component directories. Microsoft Visual C++ and WebView2 are separately licensed prerequisites and remain on uninstall if shared with other applications.

PostgreSQL support consists of PHP's `pdo_pgsql` and `pgsql` extensions and their client-library dependencies. The PostgreSQL server and its service/administration tools are not included. PostgreSQL source archives in corresponding sources also contain server code because libpq is distributed from the same upstream source tree; server binaries are not shipped.

Source code for bundled tools is available alongside the installers on the [Releases page](https://github.com/eimg/fairway-xmp/releases). The source archive includes version-matched sources, build recipes and patches, and component licenses. The application source is available in this repository. For build and redistribution instructions, see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Linux additionally bundles native libraries used by PHP, Nginx and MySQL. Component-specific library copies use their upstream licenses; Ubuntu library copyright notices are under `runtime/licenses/linux-libraries`, and exact source package/version records are in `runtime/linux-library-sources.json`. The Linux corresponding-source artifact contains their source packages, Debian/Ubuntu patches, and the build recipes. MySQL’s bundled third-party library notices remain in its distribution.
